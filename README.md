# welcome to Take Note app #

# Description of Take Note App #
A note taking app that uses express.js to act as a
server to save and display notes taken by the user. 

The goal and challenge is to take a pre-existing front-end application, establish a working back-end server with Express.js, connect the two to store data from the front end (note taking) and save the data (notes taken, saved, to study later).

Super goal: Add Delete Note feature.
